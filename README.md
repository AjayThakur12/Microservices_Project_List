#  A curated list of Open Source projects developed with a microservices architectural style

After several questions opened in Quora[4,5,6], StackOverflow [2,3], ResearchGate [1], I decided to report the list of projects that migrated to microservices or that are implemented from scratch with a microservice architectural style. 
In our previous work, we investigated several microservices issues, including migration issues[10], architectural patterns[9],  and bad smells or antipatterns[8]. The availability of a common data-set of projects implemented with a microservice architectural style, would be very useful to validate our results, but also to anyone who need to learn how to develop microservices-based applications or to researchers that want to study how these systems are architected. 


The list could be useful to anyone who need to learn how to develop microservices-based applications or to researchers tha  t want to study how these systems are architected. 

I am still  looking for a real legacy project (5-10 years old) where I can study how it evolved from Monolithic to microservices. I think this is a common issue of most of the researchers working on microservices, and if we will manage to find at least one, it could be a very good starting point.


Feel free to contribute suggesting other projects. 
You can send recommendations for new projects making a pull request to this page, or sending an email to davide [dot] taibi [at] tuni [dot] fi

## Projects that migrated from monolithic to microservces 

Still looking for something like this... 

## Acknowledgements 
This list is based on the feedbacks received in the different platforms [1][2][3][4][5][6] and on the list of microservices-based projects listed in scientific papers[7]. I  like to thank all the participants to the discussions and all theauthors of the papers that contributed to populate this list.
