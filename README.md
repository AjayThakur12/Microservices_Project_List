#  A curated List of project that migrated to microservices

After several questions opened in Quora, StackExchange, ResearchGate and to dozens of colleagues, I decided to report the list of projects that migrated to microservices or that are implemented from scratch with a microservice architectural style. 

The list could be useful to anyone who need to learn how to develop microservices-based applications or to researchers tha  t want to study how these systems are architected. 


I am still  looking for a real legacy project (5-10 years old) where I can study how it evolved from Monolithic to microservices. I think this is a common issue of most of the researchers working on microservices, and if we will manage to find at least one, it could be a very good starting point.

Feel free to contribute suggesting other projects.
